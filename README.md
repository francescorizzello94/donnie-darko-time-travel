<h1 align="center"> Donnie Darko - A Philosophy of Time Travel Website </h1>

<p align="justify">This project is developed in the spirits of providing a specific resource to analyze the philosophy of time travel in the thinking of Roberta Sparrow.
<br><br>Particularly, it is noteworthy that this project does not aim to illustrate Sparrow's philosophy of time travel (which may be comprehended by simply reading the book and watching the movie and, if needed, consulting an online explicatory resource); rather, it seeks to focus on its key elements to provide insight into a more holistic understanding thereof in the context of the movie.<br><br>
Furthermore, this project wants to provide a full-immersion mindset into Sparrow's philosophy, treating it as philosophical and scientifical set of rules theoretically applicabile to our reality. To this end, the narrative tone throughout the website is kept in line with Sparrow's work, <i>The Philosophy of Time Travel</i>.
<br>Hence, the reader embarks on a journey, as signified by the <i>travel</i> button.
<br><br>
The aim of this project is to further the Donnie Darko cult for the coming decades and to provide a resource of philosophical analysis for the contents of the movie.

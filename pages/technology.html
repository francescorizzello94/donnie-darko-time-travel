    <!-- WATER -->

      <header class="flow flow--space-small">
        <p class="fs-700 uppercase ff-serif">Water</p>
      </header>
      <p>Sparrow's work is eloquent in describing the role played by water in the Primary - Tangent Universe dynamic.<br>
    "<i>Water is the barrier element for the construction of Time Portals used as gateways between Universes as the Tangent
    Vortex.</i>"<br>
    An interesting observation which echoes ancient philosophical views, such as Thales', according to whom
    water is the <i>archÃª</i>, the originating principle of everything. Thales has also been credited with proposing
    a philosophical view unfettered by religion, protruding with his views from ancient belief into an age of scientific
    enlightenment; interestingly enough, Sparrow's approach would seem to reunite the original division and provide a holistic
    theory to merge the dichotomy of science and religion.<br>
    Water is sometimes subtly, sometimes overtly, yet never surreptitiously omnipresent in the narrative of Donnie Darko.<br>
    It promanates from individuals to guide their actions (perhaps it is a representation of each individual's divine channel?),
    seems to ripple at the touch of Frank's paw and Donnie's hand in the mirror, bursts out of water mains, liquifies the big screen.<br>
    Finally, it guides the Artifact sent by Donnie from the Tangent to the Primary Universe.

    <!-- ARTIFACT -->

    <article hidden class="technology-details flow" id="spaceport-tab" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0">
      <header class="flow flow--space-small">
        <p class="fs-700 uppercase ff-serif">Artifact</p>
      </header>
      <p>Metal is the constructional element for the shaping of an Artifact.<br>
      The encapsulation of the vessel is made by virtue of metal. It would be interesting to know whether this held in times past as well,
      as it would seem to prevent the occurrence of travel between the two Universes before metals were found and engineered for human travel.
      <br>At the same time, it may stand to reason that a Living Receiver may have come into possession of metal even in ancient times by virtue
      of the support from a Manipulated Dead entity providing the Living Receiver with a metal vessel for time travel.<br>
      We must remember that the Manipulated Dead have supernatural powers.<br>However, the vessel is naturally destined for the Primary Universe, hence
      it would seem highly irregular that such an artifact may have occurred in the Primary Universe in times previous to the discovery of metal without
      arousing disbelief and being somehow recorded.<br>
      In Donnie Darko, the artifact plays a crucial role not only in relation to preventing the rise of a Tangent Universe, but also in relation to Donnie's death,
      one of the most misunderstood elements in the movie.<br>
